# AR-QSAR-Modeling
Model for predicting the AR binding ability for environmental chemicals.

Purpose: this code takes an input of PaDEL descriptors and uses the SVM model to predict androgen receptor (AR). 
The ARQSARModeling.R is the R code for generating the model
SVMmodelAR.rda is the SVM model which can be reused to predict AR binding ability.
ToxCast-Descriptors-Active-Inactive.txt contains training and test data.
